### Base Management System

December 18, 2024

The Base Management System is a system for manage all kinds of events in a military base, such as training, exercise, sports, construction projects etc. This user-engagement project uses the Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia as an example. Therefore, the expected primary users of this system are the personnel stationed at the Norfolk Naval Base. The system will share schedules and locations of activities with relevant personnel within the base by utilizing Google Firebase.

### Do Households Value Transit-rich Neighborhoods compared to Others in Boston?

September 19, 2024

This report conducted a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) analysis of Boston, by using subway stations data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), along with American Community Survey (ACS) data of 2012 and 2022. The result shows that people are willing to pay higher prices to live near a transit station in 2022 compared to 2012.

[Day 12 Time and Space: The Beginning of Roman Catholicism in Korea](https://github.com/yjmark/30DayMapChallenge_2024_Jun/blob/main/Day12_KoreaandRomanCatholic/)
<br>In the 17th century, Catholicism was introduced to Korea by envoys traveling to and from Beijing, China. Initially, it was regarded as a new field of study rather than a religion and was referred to as \"Western Learning (Seohak)\". It is unprecedented worldwide that Catholic faith was grown by Koreans themselves before the arrival of Western missionaries.

<br>The Fare Recovery Ratio (FRR) is a measure of the extent to which a transit agency’s operating expenses are covered by passenger fares. The high FRR (close to 1) means that the agency is efficient of revenue generation from fares compared to the total operating costs of the transit services.
