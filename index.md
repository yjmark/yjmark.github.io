<img src="images/storymapimage.jpeg?raw=true"/>
This storymap aims to provide a brief history of the U.S. military and an overview of major military bases for those who may work for/with U.S. Forces regarding U.S. military facilities in the future. 
The storymap introduces five major military facilities in the U.S.: West Point, Eglin Air Force Base, Naval Station Norfolk, Camp Pendleton, and Peterson Space Force Base.

[Project 2 DefenseBoard: Dashboard Project by JavaScript](https://yjmark.github.io/dashboard-project/Jun_Youngsang/)
<img src="images/dashboardimage.jpeg?raw=true"/>
The DefenseBoard is a dashboard that uses spatial data to link various types of attributes in the defense sector such as military personnel, facilities, budget, logistics, etc.
The map on the right displays publicly accessible base locations across the United States, while on the left, users can view attribute data by base, military unit, or region.

[Project 3 Base Management System: User Engagement Project by JavaScript](https://yjmark.github.io/engagement-project/Jun_Youngsang/)
<img src="images/engagementimage.jpeg?raw=true"/>
The Base Management System is a system for manage all kinds of events in a military base, such as training, exercise, sports, construction projects etc. This engagement project uses the Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia as an example. Therefore, the expected primary users of this system are the personnel stationed at the Norfolk Naval Base. The system will share schedules and locations of activities with relevant personnel within the base.

[Day 12 Time and Space: The Beginning of Roman Catholicism in Korea](https://github.com/yjmark/30DayMapChallenge_2024_Jun/blob/main/Day12_KoreaandRomanCatholic/)

Initially, it was regarded as a new field of study rather than a religion and was referred to as \"Western Learning (Seohak)\". It is unprecedented worldwide that Catholic faith was grown by Koreans themselves before the arrival of Western missionaries.

<br>The Fare Recovery Ratio (FRR) is a measure of the extent to which a transit agency’s operating expenses are covered by passenger fares. The high FRR (close to 1) means that the agency is efficient of revenue generation from fares compared to the total operating costs of the transit services.
