### To Preserve and Well-manage Old Buildings in Philadelphia

November 19, 2024<br> Instructor: [Prof. Delmelle, Elizabeth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BjewFecAAAAJ&hl=en)

What would it feel like if my parents or grandparents’ generations lived in the same building I live in 30 or 50 years ago? As a Korean student studying abroad, I am not used to that feeling because there are a lot of new cities and new buildings in Korea, but it is very common for the residents of Philadelphia. Philadelphia’s rich history is embedded in its streets, buildings, and neighborhoods. This is confirmed by data and maps.

November 1-30, 2024<br> Instructor: [Prof. Delmelle, Elizabeth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BjewFecAAAAJ&hl=en)

[The 30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is <i>daily social mapping project happening every November</i>. In November 2024, I participated in this challenge on Day 1 (Points), Day 5 (Journey), Day 10 (Pen and Paper), Day 12 (Time and Space), Day 14 (A World Map), Day 16 (Choropleth), Day 20 (Openstreetmap), Day 22 (Two Colors), Day 24 (Only Circular), and Day 25 (Heat) to enhance my communication skills using geospatial data that is both accessible and reproducible.

[Day 1 Points: Night of Savannah](https://github.com/yjmark/30DayMapChallenge_2024_Jun/blob/main/Day01_PointsofStreetLights/) <br>The map denotes 19,024 street lights' location in the City of Savannah which Georgia Power owned.<br><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yjmark/30DayMapChallenge_2024_Jun/main/Day01_PointsofStreetLights/01-youngsang-jun.png?raw=true"/>

[Day 5 Journey: The Path of a U.S. Army Career](https://github.com/yjmark/30DayMapChallenge_2024_Jun/blob/main/Day05_Journey/) <br>How many times does a U.S. Army service member relocate? On average, they are estimated to relocate 10-12 times during a 20-year career.

[Day 12 Time and Space: The Beginning of Roman Catholicism in Korea](https://github.com/yjmark/30DayMapChallenge_2024_Jun/blob/main/Day12_KoreaandRomanCatholic/) <br>In the 17th century, Catholicism was introduced to Korea by envoys traveling to and from Beijing, China. Initially, it was regarded as a new field of study rather than a religion and was referred to as "Western Learning (Seohak)". It is unprecedented worldwide that Catholic faith was grown by Koreans themselves before the arrival of Western missionaries. <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yjmark/30DayMapChallenge_2024_Jun/main/Day12_KoreaandRomanCatholic/12-youngsang-jun.png?raw=true"/>

Some countries have street names for every road and use them in addresses, while others have few or no street names and rely instead on such as area codes, PO box numbers, or digital geocoding services like what3words.<br><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yjmark/30DayMapChallenge_2024_Jun/main/Day14_UPU_StreetAddress/14-youngsang-jun.jpg?raw=true"/>

The high FRR (close to 1) means that the agency is efficient of revenue generation from fares compared to the total operating costs of the transit services. <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yjmark/30DayMapChallenge_2024_Jun/main/Day24_OnlyCircularFRR/24-youngsang-jun.png?raw=true"/>
