  I am a civil servant of the Republic of Korea where I work for the <a href="https://www.mnd.go.kr/mbshome/mbs/mndEN">Ministry of National Defense</a>. I am currently pursuing a <a href="https://www.design.upenn.edu/urban-spatial-analytics">Master of Urban Spatial Analytics</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I am interested in the application and integration of GIS in the military field. I am also interested in address, geocoding, and wayfinding systems that utilize mobile maps.
